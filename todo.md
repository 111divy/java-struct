# jvm architecture
- interpreter
	- need everytime
	- the code will run untill it is right
	- seperate file is not generated machine code file
	- always run
	- easy for running programs
- compiler
	- no need everytime
	- the code will run only once untill the wrong things get right
	- seperate file is generated executables
	- not always be running
	- hard to debug

# java is hybrid language
- compiled and interpreted

- java compiler
	- .java to .class
- java interpreter
	- .class to executable

# java feature
- platform independent 
	- any class file can run on any os if jvm is there for them
	- due to system calls

# jvm
- sandboxing and virtual environment
- heap and seperate space to run a program

# jre
- providing environment to run the files

# Architecture of jvm
- jvm + jre  = jdk

# buzzwords
- simple
- secure: jvm has security verifier in java accordingly
- portable: platform independent
- object-oriented: abstraction, composition, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism
- robust: exception handeling run even if something is wrong
- multithreaded: use multi threads
- architecture neutral: von-neumann architecture, ARM, RISC, CICS, Embeded
- interpreted: interpreted and slow, jit compiler
- distributed: works on distributed system and os
